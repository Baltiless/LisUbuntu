Balanced Binary Tree
return -1 is better than maxvalue, and -1 is detected, we should return -1 immediately. It is not necessary to calculate other info any more.

Binary Tree Max Depth
Don't need helper;

Binary Tree Min Depth
Don't need helper;
If l || r == 0, return max(l, r).

Binary Search
(l <= h) notice =

BinaryTree zigzag
curr = s1 or s2 's order is not the same;

Path Sum I II
should have if(root.left == null && root.right == null) ...
II
notice the remove place should be at the bottom;

MaxPath Sum
notice negative number

SubsetII PermutationII
continue condition basically means the same thing in different expression if(!visited[i-1]) equals to if(i == start)

BFS
first visit than offer including Surrounded Region
