Balanced Binary Tree
return -1 is better than maxvalue, and -1 is detected, we should return -1 immediately. It is not necessary to calculate other info any more.

Binary Tree Max Depth
Don't need helper;

Binary Tree Min Depth
Don't need helper;
If l || r == 0, return max(l, r).

Binary Search
(l <= h) notice =

BinaryTree zigzag
curr = s1 or s2 's order is not the same;

Path Sum I II
should have if(root.left == null && root.right == null) ...
II
notice the remove place should be at the bottom;

MaxPath Sum
notice negative number

SubsetII PermutationII
continue condition basically means the same thing in different expression if(!visited[i-1]) equals to if(i == start)

BFS
first visit than offer including Surrounded Region

Word Search
Use char comparison rather than equals

Color Sort
l++ than i++, 'cause left have been sorted, no need to keep i

Rotate Image
offset; last should - 1

Jump GameII
step by step

Valid Parenthesis
return stack.isEmpty();

Min Stack
should also push x if x == getMin()

Compare Version
Consider the situation 1.0 vs 1

Decode Ways
should also sheck single number
as for double number should also check the lower boundary

Generate Parenthesis
left right return condition

Integer2Roman
should list all

Muliply Strings
consider the situation when product is 0

Sqrt
should use long, and return first if x == 1

SudokuII
please return early

SortList
while(runner.next != null && runner.next.next != null) very important
otherwise consider 8->7->null, infinite loop
